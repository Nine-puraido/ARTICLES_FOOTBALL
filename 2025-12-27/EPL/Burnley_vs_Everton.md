| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| 2025-26 Season | 12 games, 27 yellows, 2 reds |
| **Avg Yellows/Match** | **3.31** (career), ~2.25 this season |

**Source:** [WhoScored - Craig Pawson](https://www.whoscored.com/referees/104/show/craig-pawson)

### Team Discipline Assessment

| Team | Profile | Risk |
|------|---------|------|
| Burnley | Physical, relegation desperation | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| Everton | Controlled, tactical | LOW-MEDIUM |

**Volatility Assessment:** **MEDIUM**
- Pawson moderate this season (2.25 yellows/game)
- Burnley's relegation desperation could lead to rash challenges
- Both teams missing key players = reduced quality

---

## TOTALS ANALYSIS

**Model expects:** 2.50 goals
**Market offers:** O/U 2.25 (O: 1.99 / U: 1.88)
**Gap:** -0.25 (Minor)

### Evidence FOR Lower Scoring (Market's View):

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Burnley attack | Struggling to score, 11 points all season |
| Everton attack | Missing Ndiaye (AFCON), creative void |
| Both teams' form | Burnley 7-game losing streak, Everton 2 straight losses |
| Relegation battle | Cagey, defensive approach expected from Burnley |

### Evidence FOR Higher Scoring (Model's View):

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| H2H average | Recent meetings have produced goals |
| Burnley desperation | May open up seeking points |

**VERDICT:** Market's 2.25 is justified. Both teams missing key players and in poor form. Under 2.25 @ 1.88 offers slight value.

---

## MARKET LOGIC ANALYSIS

### Why Market is Softer on Everton AH

| Factor | Justification |
|--------|---------------|
| **Ndiaye + Gueye OUT** | Both key midfielders at AFCON |
| Everton's losing streak | 2 straight losses (Chelsea, Arsenal) |
| Burnley home form | Relegation desperation at Turf Moor |
| Branthwaite still out | Defensive concerns persist |

### CMP VERDICT: **CONSISTENT**

The -0.50 AH gap is explained by Everton's AFCON absences and recent poor form. Market correctly prices a tighter game than model suggests.

---

## FINAL STATEMENT

```
1. Market is protecting against: Everton's weakened midfield (Ndiaye
   + Gueye at AFCON) and 2-game losing streak making a comfortable
   away win unlikely at relegation-threatened Burnley

2. AH verdict: MARKET RIGHT — Everton missing two key midfielders
   justifies softer line; +0.50 appropriate given AFCON absences

3. Totals verdict: MARKET RIGHT — O/U 2.25 correctly prices both
   teams' attacking struggles and cagey relegation battle dynamics

4. Discipline risk: MEDIUM — Pawson moderate, but Burnley's
   relegation desperation could spark rash challenges

5. CMP Verdict: CONSISTENT — Both lines within expected ranges

6. Combined decision: SKIP

7. Best bet (1.80-2.20): Under 2.25 @ 1.88 has slight value given
   both teams' AFCON absences and poor attacking form

8. One-line justification: Everton missing Ndiaye + Gueye (AFCON) +
   2-game losing streak + Burnley's desperation = tight, low-scoring
   affair; market correctly prices controlled result
```

**Confidence:** LOW

*Both teams significantly weakened by absences. No clear value.*

---

## REASONING

The -0.50 AH gap is explained by confirmed context:

1. **Confirmed fact:** Everton missing Ndiaye + Gueye (AFCON - Senegal)
2. **Confirmed fact:** Everton on 2-game losing streak (Chelsea, Arsenal)
3. **Confirmed fact:** Burnley on 7-game losing streak before Bournemouth draw
4. **Confirmed fact:** Burnley missing Foster, Tuanzebe, Mejbri (AFCON)
5. **Confirmed fact:** Everton 4/5 wins in recent H2H

Both teams are weakened by AFCON. The market correctly prices a tighter game. Everton should still win given H2H dominance, but margin is uncertain.

**No strong value identified.**

## POST-MATCH RESULT & KEY TAKEAWAYS

**Final Score:** Burnley 0-0 Everton

### Result Analysis

| Bet Type | Line | Outcome |
|----------|------|---------|
| **Under 2.25** | @ 1.88 | **WON** (0 goals) |

### What Happened

- 0-0 draw — lowest possible scoring outcome
- Under 2.25 won comfortably
- Both teams' AFCON absences proved decisive
- Neither team could create quality chances

### Key Lessons

| Issue | Learning |
|-------|----------|
| **AFCON impact validated** | Both teams missing key players = no goals |
| **Cagey relegation battle** | As predicted, both teams prioritized not losing |
| **Attacking crisis confirmed** | Burnley couldn't score, Everton's Ndiaye/Gueye absences showed |

### What I Got Right

- **Total goals** — Under 2.25 was correct (0 goals)
- **AFCON impact** — Correctly identified both teams' weakened squads
- **Cagey affair prediction** — Relegation battle produced exactly the tight game expected
- **Everton's creative void** — Without Ndiaye, they couldn't create

### What I Got Wrong

- **Match winner** — Slight lean to Everton didn't materialize (draw)
- **Could have been more confident** — Called it SKIP but Under 2.25 had clear value

### Validation

> This was the most straightforward Under bet of the day. Both teams
> missing AFCON players (Burnley: Foster, Tuanzebe, Mejbri; Everton:
> Ndiaye, Gueye) + relegation stakes = 0-0 was logical outcome.
> AFCON absences proved to be reliable indicator for low-scoring games.

### Future Application

1. **AFCON absences on BOTH teams = strong Under indicator** — especially when attacking players affected
2. **Relegation battles with depleted squads often produce 0-0** — neither can afford to lose
3. **Should have had higher confidence on Under** — evidence was stronger than I acknowledged
