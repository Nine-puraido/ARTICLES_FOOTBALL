# MUST-USE BETTING LOGIC

**Last Updated:** December 29, 2025

## CORE PRINCIPLES

### 1. Respect BOTH Market and Model

- **NEVER** underestimate the market — they usually know something
- **NEVER** dismiss the model — it has data we don't see
- Both have blind spots: Model lacks injury/news info; Market can overreact to narratives

### 2. When Market and Model Disagree

The disagreement is usually because:
- Market has **injury info** the model doesn't
- Market is **risk-managing** based on schedule/motivation
- Market is pricing **this specific match**, not averages

**Key Question:** Is the market soft/aggressive ENOUGH given the circumstances?

## MARKET VS MODEL GAP ANALYSIS

### When Market is SOFTER Than Model (Favorite Gets Worse Line)

| Scenario | Analysis | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Minor injuries (1-2 players) | Market may be overreacting | Check if model value exists |
| Major injuries (3+ key players) | Market is correct to soften | Check if soft ENOUGH |
| AFCON/International duty | Significant impact | Verify market adjustment is sufficient |
| Fixture congestion | Rotation expected | Usually market is right |

**Example:** Man United vs Newcastle — Model said -0.25, market softened to 0.00 due to 7+ injuries. But 0.25 gap wasn't enough for 7 missing players. Market should have favored Newcastle. **Result: Market wasn't soft enough.**

### When Market is MORE AGGRESSIVE Than Model

| Favorite Location | Pattern | Action |
|-------------------|---------|--------|
| **Home favorite** | Often FAILS to cover | Lean SKIP or underdog |
| **Away favorite** | Market may know something | Investigate before deciding |

**Example:** Milan vs Verona — Market -1.50, Model -1.25. Market was MORE aggressive on home favorite. Usually this fails, but Milan had 9-game H2H dominance + Verona 0 wins in 38 San Siro visits. **Result: Market was right due to extreme H2H pattern.**

## COMPARABLE-MATCH PRICING (CMP)

### How to Calculate CMP Properly

1. **Find Team A vs similar-level opponents** (same venue, similar context)
2. **Find similar-level teams vs Team B** (same venue, similar context)
3. **Compare market prices** from those matches to current match
4. **Adjust for conditions:** injuries, red cards, match intensity, schedule

### Home vs Away Adjustment

**General rule:** Home advantage ≈ 0.50 goals

| If Team A vs Team B at A's home | Then Team B vs Team A at B's home |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Team A -0.50 | Should be ~0.00 (pick'em) |
| Team A -1.00 | Should be ~Team B -0.50 |

*Assumes no injuries or significant form changes*

## LESSONS FROM POST-MATCH ANALYSIS

### 1. H2H/VENUE ADVANTAGE + MARKET CONFIDENCE = BET

H2H and venue patterns alone are NOT the signal. The signal is **whether market is pricing that advantage confidently**.

| Scenario | Market Behavior | Action |
|----------|-----------------|--------|
| H2H/venue advantage exists + Market AGREES (aggressive) | Market knows and is confident | **BET** |
| H2H/venue advantage exists + Market DISAGREES (soft/backs opponent) | Market knows something we don't | **CAUTION** |

**Example — Milan vs Verona:**
- H2H: Milan 9 straight wins, Verona 0 wins in 38 San Siro visits
- Model: -1.25 Milan
- Market: -1.50 Milan (MORE aggressive)
- **Market KNOWS the venue/H2H advantage and is CONFIDENT** → BET Milan
- Result: Milan 3-0 ✓

**Example — If Market Had Been Soft:**
- Same H2H/venue stats
- But if market was -0.75 or pick'em while model said -1.25
- This means market is NOT confident despite the advantage → investigate why

**Rule:** H2H/venue patterns are context. Market confidence in pricing that advantage is the signal.

---

### 2. WHEN MARKET BACKS OPPONENT DESPITE H2H/VENUE ADVANTAGE

If historical advantage exists for Team A but market is backing Team B:
- Market has information we don't
- Injuries, motivation, tactical changes may override history
- **DO NOT** blindly trust H2H — trust the market's skepticism

**Rule:** H2H/venue advantage + market backing opponent = SKIP or investigate deeply.

---

### 3. NEVER LABEL "MODEL ERROR" WITHOUT OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE

| Match | My Call | Result |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Torino vs Cagliari (Dec 27) | Called model "ERROR" — backed Torino | Cagliari won 2-1 |

**Rule:** Model sees data we don't. "1 win in 13" doesn't mean win #2 can't happen TODAY. Require overwhelming evidence before dismissing model.

---

### 4. INJURY LISTS ≠ GUARANTEED LOSSES

Spurs missing 8 players (Simons, Romero suspended + Bissouma, Sarr AFCON + Maddison, Solanke, Kulusevski, Udogie injured) → Still won 1-0 at Crystal Palace.

**Rule:** Absence lists are CONTEXT, not destiny. Teams adapt. "Crisis mode" ≠ automatic loss.

---

### 5. AFCON IMPACT IS REAL — PRICE IT CORRECTLY

| Match | AFCON Impact | Result |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| Sunderland vs Leeds | 6 players missing | Drew 1-1 (couldn't hold lead) |
| Atalanta vs Inter | Lookman + Kossounou out | Lost 0-1 (toothless attack) |

**Rule:** AFCON matters. Check if market is soft ENOUGH, not just soft.

---

### 6. CLEAN SHEET PATTERNS → LEAN UNDER

Inter had 4 consecutive clean sheets vs Atalanta → became 5th.

**Rule:** When one team consistently shuts out another (4+ times), bet UNDER. Pattern indicates defensive dominance.

---

### 7. DERBY DYNAMICS → EXPECT DRAWS

Bologna 1-1 Sassuolo — "unbeaten in 4 H2H" included draws, not just wins.

**Rule:** Derbies trend toward draws. Don't back ML confidently in local rivalries.

---

### 8. SKIP MEANS SKIP

Bologna vs Sassuolo: Called SKIP but listed "Bologna ML @ 1.85" anyway → wrong.

**Rule:** If confidence is LOW and main call is SKIP, trust it. Don't hedge with "best bet" suggestions.

---

### 9. UNDER 2.5 > UNDER 2.0

Sunderland vs Leeds: Under 2.0 @ 2.12 → PUSH (exactly 2 goals).

**Rule:** When thesis is "low-scoring," prefer Under 2.5 at worse odds. Safety margin avoids pushes.

---

### 10. TOTALS AND MATCH WINNER ARE SEPARATE

| Match | Winner Call | Totals Call | Result |
|-------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Palace vs Spurs | Palace (WRONG) | Under 2.5 (WON) | 0-1 |
| Bologna vs Sassuolo | Bologna (WRONG) | Under 2.5 (WON) | 1-1 |

**Rule:** Separate theses. When uncertain on winner, focus on totals only.

---

## QUICK REFERENCE: DECISION MATRIX

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| H2H/venue advantage + Market AGREES (aggressive) | **BET** — market is confident |
| H2H/venue advantage + Market DISAGREES (soft/backs opponent) | **CAUTION** — market knows something |
| Market softer than model (injuries) | Check if soft ENOUGH → **BET** if not soft enough |
| Market MORE aggressive than model (home fav) | Usually fails — **SKIP** unless H2H/venue justifies |
| Market MORE aggressive than model (away fav) | Market may know something — **investigate** |
| Model and market AGREE + clear advantage exists | **BET** — both sources aligned |
| Model and market AGREE + no clear edge | **SKIP** |
| Derby + both teams poor form | **SKIP** or Under only |
| AFCON/major absences + low confidence | **REDUCE** stake |
| Clean sheet pattern in H2H (4+) | Lean **UNDER** |
| Confidence LOW but want to bet anyway | **SKIP** — trust your analysis |

---

## RED FLAGS — WHEN TO STOP AND RECONSIDER

1. You're about to call "MODEL ERROR" — do you have overwhelming evidence?
2. You're betting on H2H/venue advantage but **market is backing the opponent** — why is market not confident?
3. You're fading market's aggressive line because of "short-term form" — does market know something?
4. You said SKIP but you're adding a "best bet" anyway — why?
5. You're backing a "crisis" team to lose — have you seen them adapt before?
6. Market and model AGREE but you want to go opposite — what do YOU know that they don't?
