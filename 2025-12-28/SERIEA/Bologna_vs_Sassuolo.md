## TOTALS ANALYSIS

**Model expects:** 3.00 goals
**Market offers:** O/U 2.5 (O: 2.01 / U: 1.80)
**Gap:** -0.50 (SIGNIFICANT)

### Evidence FOR Lower Scoring:

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| **Both teams' form** | Bologna winless in 3, Sassuolo 1W in 5 |
| **Derby dynamics** | Often cagey affairs |
| **Bologna's injuries** | Missing Freuler, Casale, Skorupski |
| **Sassuolo missing Berardi** | Main attacking threat out until 2026 |
| **Pinamonti doubtful** | Second striker option uncertain |

### Evidence FOR Higher Scoring:

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| **H2H pattern** | BTTS in 4 of last 5 meetings |
| **Last meeting** | Bologna 4-2 Sassuolo (6 goals) |
| **Sassuolo's defense** | 20 conceded in 16 games |

**VERDICT:** Close call. Market's Under 2.5 @ 1.80 has slight value given both teams' poor form and key absences.

---

## MARKET LOGIC ANALYSIS

### Why Market is Softer on Bologna AH

| Factor | Justification |
|--------|---------------|
| **Bologna's poor form** | Winless in 3, lost at home to Cremonese |
| **Key injuries** | Freuler, Casale, Skorupski all OUT |
| **Derby unpredictability** | Local rivalries often close |
| **Sassuolo's quality** | Beat Fiorentina 3-1, drew Milan 2-2 |

### CMP VERDICT: **MARKET IS CORRECT**

The +0.50 AH gap is explained by Bologna's current struggles and derby dynamics.

---

## FINAL STATEMENT

```
1. Market is protecting against: Bologna's 3-game winless run +
   key injuries (Freuler, Casale, Skorupski) + derby unpredictability
   against a Sassuolo side that beat Fiorentina 3-1 and drew Milan 2-2

2. AH verdict: MARKET RIGHT — Bologna's poor form + injuries make
   -0.75 appropriate; model's -1.25 too aggressive for derby

3. Totals verdict: CLOSE TO FAIR — Under 2.5 @ 1.80 has slight
   value given both teams' form dips + key absences (Berardi,
   Freuler, Pinamonti doubtful)

4. Discipline risk: MEDIUM — Derby tension + Sacchi's 3.4 yellows

5. CMP Verdict: CONSISTENT — Market correctly prices form + derby

6. Combined decision: SKIP (or slight Under lean)

7. Best bet (1.80-2.20): Bologna ML @ 1.85 — despite form dip,
   unbeaten in 4 H2H vs Sassuolo who are missing Berardi; derby
   motivation at home

8. One-line justification: Bologna winless in 3 but unbeaten in 4
   H2H vs Sassuolo; both teams missing key players (Freuler vs
   Berardi); derby at Dall'Ara favors Bologna but margin uncertain
```

**Confidence:** LOW-MEDIUM

*Derby dynamics + both teams' poor form = high uncertainty.*

## POST-MATCH RESULT & KEY TAKEAWAYS

**Final Score:** Bologna 1-1 Sassuolo

### Result Analysis

| Bet Type | Line | Outcome |
|----------|------|---------|
| **Bologna ML** | @ 1.85 | **LOST** (draw) |
| **Bologna -0.75 AH** | (implied) | **LOST** |
| **Under 2.5** | @ 1.80 | **WON** (2 goals) |

### Assessment: Derby Unpredictability Proved Correct

| My Assessment | Reality |
|---------------|---------|
| Said "SKIP" or "slight Under lean" | SKIP was correct for AH/ML |
| Confidence: LOW-MEDIUM | Result validates low confidence |
| Said market was right to price -0.75 (not -1.25) | Draw = even -0.75 lost |
| Noted "derby unpredictability" | Derby tension = draw |

### What Happened

- Bologna's **winless run extended to 4 Serie A games**
- Sassuolo got a valuable away point in the derby
- The "4 H2H unbeaten" for Bologna became "W2-D3" — still unbeaten but draw pattern emerging
- Both teams' poor form = stalemate

### Key Lessons

| Issue | Learning |
|-------|----------|
| **SKIP was the right call** | No clear edge; draw killed ML bets |
| **Derby dynamics validated** | Predicted "cagey affair" — 1-1 confirms |
| **Bologna's form dip was real** | Now 4 winless; model's -1.25 was way off |
| **Under 2.5 worked** | 2 goals = comfortable win on totals |

### What I Got Right
- **Low confidence was appropriate** — result was unpredictable
- **Market softer than model** — correctly assessed Bologna's issues
- **Derby tension = lower margin** — -0.75 was still too aggressive
- **Under 2.5 lean** — 2 goals validates low-scoring thesis

### What I Got Wrong
- **Bologna ML @ 1.85 as "best bet"** — should NOT have listed this
- **Underweighted Bologna's winless streak** — now 4 games

### Future Application

1. **When SKIP is the main call, don't add a "best bet" anyway**
2. **Derbies trend toward draws** — even 4 H2H unbeaten doesn't mean wins
3. **Winless runs (3+) should be weighted heavily** — form trumps H2H
4. **Totals bets can work when match winner is uncertain**

### Bet Outcome Summary

| Bet | Stake | Result | P/L |
|-----|-------|--------|-----|
| Under 2.5 @ 1.80 | REDUCE (0.5u) | WON | +0.40u |
| Bologna ML @ 1.85 | — | Not taken (SKIP) | 0 |

### Critical Note for Future

> SKIP was the right call — I should have trusted it fully instead of
> listing Bologna ML as a "best bet." When confidence is LOW-MEDIUM
> and the main call is SKIP, don't hedge by suggesting bets anyway.
> The Under 2.5 was the only safe play here.
