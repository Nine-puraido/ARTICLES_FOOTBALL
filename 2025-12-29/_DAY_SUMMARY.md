## Daily P/L: **-1.00u**

## What Happened

### Roma 3-1 Genoa
- Roma's H2H dominance continued — now **17/19 home wins**
- Genoa's **3rd choice GK** exposed — conceded 3
- Roma's "broken attack" scored 3 goals
- Genoa STILL haven't won at Roma since 1990 (35 years)

---

## Critical Error Analysis

| Our Call | Result | Lesson |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Trusted market skepticism @ 2.22 | Market was WRONG | Extreme H2H + crisis = override market |
| Bet Under 2.0 | 4 goals scored | GK crisis = lean OVER |
| SKIPPED Roma -1.00 | Would have WON | 2.22 was VALUE, not a trap |

---

## Key Lessons

### 1. When Fundamentals Override Market Skepticism

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| H2H exists + Market soft | Trust market skepticism |
| H2H **EXTREME** (15+) + **Critical crisis** (GK, 5+ out) | **BET favorite despite soft odds** |

### 2. GK Crisis = Lean OVER, Not Under
- 3rd choice keeper will concede goals
- We bet Under expecting grinding game
- Reality: GK got exposed, 4 goals total

### 3. Market Can Be Wrong
- Market overreacted to Roma's short-term attacking issues
- Ignored structural advantages (H2H + GK crisis)
- 2.22 on 16/18 H2H team was screaming value

---

## Rule to Add (Pending)

**When to Override Market Skepticism:**

All THREE must be true:
1. H2H dominance is **EXTREME** (15+ wins, decades without loss)
2. Opponent has **CRITICAL crisis** (GK crisis, 5+ key absences)
3. Market still favors the dominant team (just at soft odds)

→ **BET the favorite. Market is overreacting.**

---

## Missed Value

Roma -1.00 @ 2.22 should have been ~1.85-1.90 given:
- 16/18 H2H dominance
- 35 years without Genoa win at Roma
- 3rd choice GK

**We left +1.22u on the table by trusting market skepticism.**
