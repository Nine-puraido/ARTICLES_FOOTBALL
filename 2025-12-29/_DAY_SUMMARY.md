## Pre-Match Notes

### Roma vs Genoa
- **H2H:** Roma 16/18 home wins, Genoa no win since 1990
- **Genoa GK Crisis:** 3rd choice keeper starting (Leali suspended, Siegrist injured)
- **Market Skepticism:** Roma -1.00 @ 2.22 is TOO SOFT given advantages
- **Decision:** SKIP Roma AH, BET Under 2.0
- **Reasoning:** Market doesn't trust Roma to cover despite all advantages

---

## Key Observations
- Market's unusual softness on Roma is a RED FLAG
- When market doesn't back obvious favorite, trust the skepticism
- Under 2.0 is where market IS confident
