## Pre-Match Analysis Summary

### 1. Crystal Palace vs Fulham (15:00)
- **Key Finding:** Palace have NOT SCORED at home vs Fulham in last 4 meetings (0 goals)
- **Palace Form:** 1W-4L last 5 (dire)
- **Fulham Form:** 3W-2L, ON 3-GAME AWAY WINNING STREAK
- **AFCON Impact:** Both teams affected (Palace: Sarr; Fulham: Chukwueze, Iwobi, Bassey)
- **Decision:** SKIP — Market correctly pricing Palace's home scoring drought

### 2. Liverpool vs Leeds (17:30)
- **Key Finding:** 1-GOAL GAP on Totals (Model 3.75 vs Market 2.75)
- **Critical Absences:**
  - Liverpool: Salah (AFCON), Isak (injury)
  - Leeds: Rodon (key CB, first miss since Oct 2023)
- **Recent H2H:** 3-3 on Dec 6 BUT Rodon was playing
- **Market Logic:** Without Rodon, Leeds will park bus; without Salah, Liverpool less explosive
- **Decision:** SKIP — Market correctly pricing controlled 2-0 or 2-1 Liverpool win

### 3. Sunderland vs Man City (15:00)
- **Key Finding:** Sunderland UNBEATEN at home (9-0-0) vs City 8-game winning streak
- **AFCON Impact:** Sunderland losing 6 players
- **City Rotation:** Guardiola confirmed rotation for January
- **H2H:** City 8-0 vs Sunderland in last 8 meetings
- **Decision:** SKIP — Rotation uncertainty too high; City 1.40 too short

### 4. Brentford vs Tottenham (20:00)
- **Key Finding:** Spurs beat Brentford 2-0 AT GTECH just 3 weeks ago (Dec 6)
- **Thomas Frank Factor:** Frank now manages Spurs (his former club)
- **Spurs Away Form:** 5W-2D-2L (1.89 PPG) — STRONG
- **Discipline Risk:** HIGH (Madley 3.24 PPG + Spurs red-card volatility)
- **Decision:** SKIP — Recent same-venue H2H supports market caution

## Key AFCON Absences

| Team | Players at AFCON |
|------|------------------|
| Crystal Palace | Sarr (Senegal) |
| Fulham | Chukwueze, Iwobi, Bassey (Nigeria) |
| Liverpool | Salah (Egypt) |
| Leeds | None |
| Sunderland | Masuaku, Sadiki, Mandava, Traore, Talbi, Diarra (6 players!) |
| Man City | Marmoush (Egypt), Ait-Nouri (Algeria) |
| Brentford | Ouattara, Onyeka |
| Tottenham | Bissouma, Sarr |

---

## Key Themes for January 1

### 1. AFCON Impact Is Massive
- Multiple teams losing key players
- Sunderland worst affected (6 players)
- Liverpool without Salah is a different team

### 2. Market Respecting Recent H2H
- Brentford vs Spurs: Market pricing Dec 6 result (2-0 Spurs)
- Palace vs Fulham: Market pricing Palace's home scoring drought
- Liverpool vs Leeds: Market pricing Rodon's absence changing dynamics

### 3. Rotation Season
- Multiple managers (Slot, Guardiola) confirmed rotation
- 9 games in 31 days for some teams
- Creates execution uncertainty

### 4. All 4 Matches = SKIP
- No clear edges identified
- Markets appear correctly priced
- AFCON + rotation + holiday fixtures = high uncertainty

## Rules Applied

| Rule | Match Applied |
|------|---------------|
| #12 Recent same-venue H2H | Brentford vs Spurs (Spurs 2-0 at Gtech Dec 6) |
| #14 Venue-specific patterns | Palace vs Fulham (Palace 0 goals in 4 home H2H) |
| #5 AFCON Impact | Sunderland (6 players), Liverpool (Salah) |

---

## KEY LESSONS FROM JANUARY 1

### 1. Holiday Fixture Congestion = LEAN UNDER
- 3 out of 4 matches were 0-0
- Teams prioritizing not losing over winning
- Fatigue + rotation + AFCON = low-scoring

### 2. AFCON + Key Absences = HEAVY UNDER
- Liverpool without Salah = toothless
- Leeds without Rodon = parked bus
- Result: 0-0 (Under crushed)

### 3. Newly Promoted Home Fortress Is REAL
- Sunderland (10-0-0 at home) held City to 0-0
- Even with 6 AFCON players missing
- City 1.40 was NOT safe

### 4. Manager vs Former Club = Tactical Stalemate
- Thomas Frank vs Brentford = 0-0
- Both sides neutralized each other
- Under was the play

### 5. When Model-Market Totals Gap Is 1+ Goals
- Liverpool: Model 3.75, Market 2.75
- Result: 0 goals
- **TRUST MARKET'S CAUTION on Totals**

## What We Got Right

1. Liverpool Under 2.75 — IDENTIFIED as best bet
2. Brentford vs Spurs Under 2.5 — IDENTIFIED as best option
3. City 1.40 "too short" — CORRECT
4. Palace home scoring drought — Noted (though it broke)

## What We Missed

1. Should have been MORE confident on Unders
2. Sunderland +1.50 was better than we suggested
3. Draw @ 3.50-4.38 had value on holiday fixtures
