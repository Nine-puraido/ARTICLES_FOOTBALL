# Monthly Lessons Learned: December 2025

## Key Lessons

### 1. H2H/Venue Advantage + Market Confidence = Signal
- H2H alone is NOT the signal
- Market's CONFIDENCE in pricing that advantage is the signal
- If market is soft despite H2H advantage → CAUTION

**Example:** Milan vs Verona — Market aggressive (-1.50) + H2H dominance = BET. Result: 3-0 Milan.

---

### 2. Never Label "MODEL ERROR" Without Overwhelming Evidence
- Model sees data we don't
- "Bad form" doesn't mean they can't win TODAY

**Example:** Torino vs Cagliari — Called model "ERROR", backed Torino. Cagliari won 2-1.

---

### 3. When Market is Soft on Obvious Favorite → Trust Skepticism
- Market knows something we don't
- Don't bet on H2H/venue when market doesn't back it

**Example:** Roma vs Genoa — Roma -1.00 @ 2.22 despite 16/18 H2H wins + Genoa GK crisis. Market skeptical.

---

### 4. AFCON Absences Matter — Check if Soft ENOUGH
- AFCON impact is real
- But check if market adjustment is SUFFICIENT

**Example:** Sunderland (6 AFCON absences) vs Leeds — Market adjusted to pick'em. Drew 1-1.

---

### 5. Under 2.5 > Under 2.0 for Safety
- When thesis is "low-scoring," prefer Under 2.5
- Avoids pushes on exactly 2 goals

**Example:** Sunderland vs Leeds — Under 2.0 pushed at 2 goals.

---

### 6. Totals and Match Winner Are Separate Theses
- Can win Under bet while losing match winner bet
- Focus on totals when uncertain on winner

**Example:** Palace vs Spurs — Palace wrong, Under 2.5 won.

---

### 7. Injury Lists ≠ Guaranteed Losses
- Teams adapt
- "Crisis mode" doesn't mean automatic loss

**Example:** Spurs won 1-0 at Palace despite 8 players missing.

---

### 8. Clean Sheet Patterns in H2H → Lean Under
- When one team consistently shuts out another (4+), bet Under

**Example:** Inter vs Atalanta — 5th consecutive clean sheet.

---

### 9. Derby Dynamics → Expect Draws
- Derbies trend toward draws
- Don't back ML confidently

**Example:** Bologna 1-1 Sassuolo

---

### 10. SKIP Means SKIP
- If confidence is LOW and call is SKIP, trust it
- Don't add "best bet" anyway

---
