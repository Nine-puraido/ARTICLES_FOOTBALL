## COMPARABLE-MATCH PRICING (CMP)

### Market Pricing Analysis

| Team | League Position | 1X2 Odds | Implied Probability |
|------|-----------------|----------|---------------------|
| Parma (H) | 16th | 3.32 | 30% |
| Draw | — | 3.10 | 32% |
| Fiorentina (A) | **20th (BOTTOM)** | 2.32 | 43% |

### CMP VERDICT: **POTENTIAL ANOMALY**

**Unusual Factors:**
1. Bottom-of-table team (20th) priced as **away favorite** — rare
2. H2H is **6 straight draws** yet Draw is not shortest price
3. Fiorentina have won **1 away game at Parma in 11 trips** since 2020
4. Market may be overweighting Fiorentina's 5-1 win (vs 10 men for 83 mins)

**What Market is Pricing:**
- Parma's catastrophic home form (1 win, 6-game winless)
- Parma's worst attack in Serie A (10 goals)
- Moise Kean's individual quality
- Fiorentina's "confidence boost" from 5-1 win

**What Market is IGNORING:**
- H2H pattern: 6 straight draws
- Fiorentina's overall form: 1 win in 16 before Udinese
- Fiorentina's away record at Parma: 1 win in 11 trips
- Context of 5-1 win: vs 10 men from 7th minute

---

## TOTALS ANALYSIS

**Model expects:** 2.50 goals
**Market offers:** O/U 2.5
**Gap:** 0.00 (Agreement)

### Evidence FOR Lower Scoring:

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| **H2H Pattern** | Under 2.5 in last 4 meetings |
| **H2H Pattern** | Under 1.5 in last 3 meetings |
| **Parma attack** | Worst in Serie A — 10 goals in 15 games |
| **Draw-heavy fixture** | 6 straight draws = cagey affairs |

### Evidence FOR Higher Scoring:

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Fiorentina defense | Joint-worst in Serie A (27 conceded) |
| Moise Kean | Top scorer capability |

**VERDICT:** Market correctly priced at O/U 2.5. H2H strongly supports Under.

## JOINT MARKET LOGIC ANALYSIS

### The +0.50 AH Gap Explained

| Market Justification | Counter-Evidence |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Parma can't win at home | True, but H2H = 6 straight draws |
| Fiorentina won 5-1 | Vs 10 men from 7th minute — artificial |
| Kean is quality | 1 away win at Parma in 11 trips since 2020 |
| Fiorentina form boost | 1 win in 16 before Udinese (bottom of table) |

### Assessment

The market appears to be **overreacting** to Fiorentina's 5-1 result while ignoring:
- The H2H draw pattern (strongest signal)
- Fiorentina's overall terrible form (1/16 before Udinese)
- The context of that win (10 men from 7th minute)

**The Draw at 3.10 is undervalued** given 6 straight draws in H2H.

---

## WHY MARKET PRICES FIORENTINA AS FAVORITES

1. **Parma's home form** — 1 win all season, lost to 9-man Lazio
2. **Parma's attack** — Worst in Serie A, can't capitalize
3. **Moise Kean** — Elite striker who can decide tight games
4. **Fiorentina's 5-1 boost** — (but misleading context)

---

## DISCIPLINE OVERRIDE CHECK

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Is red card risk elevated? | NO — Low-Medium |
| Does bet require margin expansion? | NO — small lines |
| Does referee amplify volatility? | MODERATE only |

**No discipline override required.**

---

## FINAL STATEMENT

```
1. Market is protecting against: Parma's inability to score or win
   at home (worst attack in Serie A, 1 home win all season, lost
   to 9-man Lazio)

2. AH verdict: POTENTIAL BAIT — Market overweighting Fiorentina's
   5-1 win (vs 10 men) while ignoring 6 straight draws in H2H and
   Fiorentina's 1 away win at Parma in 11 trips since 2020

3. Totals verdict: MARKET RIGHT — O/U 2.5 correctly priced;
   H2H shows Under 2.5 in last 4, Under 1.5 in last 3

4. Discipline risk: LOW-MEDIUM — Marco Guida experienced,
   neither team volatile

5. CMP Verdict: ANOMALY — Bottom-of-table team priced as away
   favorite contradicts H2H pattern of 6 straight draws

6. Combined decision: REDUCE (Draw value exists)

7. Best bet (1.80-2.20): Draw @ 3.10 OR Under 2.5 @ ~1.90
   (H2H strongly supports both)

8. One-line justification: 6 straight H2H draws + Fiorentina's
   1 away win at Parma in 11 trips + both teams' attacking
   struggles make the Draw undervalued at 3.10; market overweights
   Fiorentina's 5-1 win vs 10-man Udinese
```

**Confidence:** MEDIUM

*H2H pattern is strong (6 draws), but both teams are unpredictable relegation candidates.*

---

## REASONING

The +0.50 AH gap is **NOT fully explained** by confirmed context:

1. **Confirmed fact:** H2H is 6 straight draws
2. **Confirmed fact:** Fiorentina have 1 away win at Parma in 11 trips (2020)
3. **Confirmed fact:** Fiorentina's 5-1 was vs 10-man Udinese from 7th min
4. **Confirmed fact:** Fiorentina are bottom of Serie A with 9 points
5. **Confirmed fact:** Parma lost to 9-man Lazio at home

The model treats this as home advantage for Parma. The market overweights Fiorentina's misleading 5-1 win. The H2H pattern (6 draws, Under 1.5 in last 3) is the strongest predictor.

**Market MAY be mispricing. Draw offers value.**

---

## BASELINE RULE ASSESSMENT

> Strong evidence (H2H: 6 straight draws) suggests market MAY be mispricing.
> Draw at 3.10 offers value given pattern.
> **Recommendation: REDUCE stake if backing Fiorentina. Consider Draw @ 3.10**
