## TOTALS ANALYSIS

**Model expects:** 3.00 goals
**Market offers:** O/U 2.5 (O: 2.01 / U: 1.80)
**Gap:** -0.50 (SIGNIFICANT)

### Evidence FOR Lower Scoring:

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| **Both teams' form** | Bologna winless in 3, Sassuolo 1W in 5 |
| **Derby dynamics** | Often cagey affairs |
| **Bologna's injuries** | Missing Freuler, Casale, Skorupski |
| **Sassuolo missing Berardi** | Main attacking threat out until 2026 |
| **Pinamonti doubtful** | Second striker option uncertain |

### Evidence FOR Higher Scoring:

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| **H2H pattern** | BTTS in 4 of last 5 meetings |
| **Last meeting** | Bologna 4-2 Sassuolo (6 goals) |
| **Sassuolo's defense** | 20 conceded in 16 games |

**VERDICT:** Close call. Market's Under 2.5 @ 1.80 has slight value given both teams' poor form and key absences.

---

## MARKET LOGIC ANALYSIS

### Why Market is Softer on Bologna AH

| Factor | Justification |
|--------|---------------|
| **Bologna's poor form** | Winless in 3, lost at home to Cremonese |
| **Key injuries** | Freuler, Casale, Skorupski all OUT |
| **Derby unpredictability** | Local rivalries often close |
| **Sassuolo's quality** | Beat Fiorentina 3-1, drew Milan 2-2 |

### CMP VERDICT: **MARKET IS CORRECT**

The +0.50 AH gap is explained by Bologna's current struggles and derby dynamics.

---

## FINAL STATEMENT

```
1. Market is protecting against: Bologna's 3-game winless run +
   key injuries (Freuler, Casale, Skorupski) + derby unpredictability
   against a Sassuolo side that beat Fiorentina 3-1 and drew Milan 2-2

2. AH verdict: MARKET RIGHT — Bologna's poor form + injuries make
   -0.75 appropriate; model's -1.25 too aggressive for derby

3. Totals verdict: CLOSE TO FAIR — Under 2.5 @ 1.80 has slight
   value given both teams' form dips + key absences (Berardi,
   Freuler, Pinamonti doubtful)

4. Discipline risk: MEDIUM — Derby tension + Sacchi's 3.4 yellows

5. CMP Verdict: CONSISTENT — Market correctly prices form + derby

6. Combined decision: SKIP (or slight Under lean)

7. Best bet (1.80-2.20): Bologna ML @ 1.85 — despite form dip,
   unbeaten in 4 H2H vs Sassuolo who are missing Berardi; derby
   motivation at home

8. One-line justification: Bologna winless in 3 but unbeaten in 4
   H2H vs Sassuolo; both teams missing key players (Freuler vs
   Berardi); derby at Dall'Ara favors Bologna but margin uncertain
```

**Confidence:** LOW-MEDIUM

*Derby dynamics + both teams' poor form = high uncertainty.*
