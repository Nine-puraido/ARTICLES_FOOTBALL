| Career Average | 3.71 yellows/game |
| Recent Average | 4.25 yellows/game |

---

## TOTALS ANALYSIS

**Model expects:** 2.75 goals
**Market offers:** O/U 2.5 (O: 1.90 / U: 1.90)
**Gap:** -0.25 (Minor)

### Evidence FOR Lower Scoring:

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Milan's controlled style | Allegri = defensive organization |
| Verona's low-scoring losses | Often lose 1-0 or 2-0 |
| Milan's recent games | Won 1-0, 2-0 recently |

### Evidence FOR Higher Scoring:

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| H2H average | 2.86 goals/game historically |
| BTTS rate | 62% of H2H meetings |
| Verona conceding | 17 straight San Siro games conceding (37 goals) |
| Milan attacking depth | Pulisic, Nkunku, even without Leao |

**VERDICT:** Close to fair. O/U 2.5 balanced line. No strong edge.

## MARKET LOGIC ANALYSIS

### Why Market is MORE Aggressive on Milan (-1.50 vs -1.25)

| Factor | Justification |
|--------|---------------|
| **H2H dominance** | 9 straight Milan wins, Verona never won at San Siro |
| **Quality gap** | 2nd vs 18th in Serie A |
| **Verona's away record** | Terrible historically at San Siro |
| **Milan title race** | Need to keep pace with Inter |

### Why Model is LESS Aggressive

| Factor | Justification |
|--------|---------------|
| **Verona's recent form** | Back-to-back wins (beat Atalanta 3-1!) |
| **Milan's slight dip** | Winless in 2, lost to Napoli |
| **Leao doubtful** | Key attacker may not start |

### CMP VERDICT: **MARKET MAY BE SLIGHTLY OVER-AGGRESSIVE**

Verona's recent wins (including 3-1 at Atalanta) suggest they're not as weak as 18th place indicates.

---

## FINAL STATEMENT

```
1. Market is protecting against: Nothing — market is MORE aggressive
   on Milan (-1.50) than model (-1.25), pricing complete dominance
   based on 9-game winning streak and Verona's 0 wins in 38 San Siro visits

2. AH verdict: MARKET MAY BE OVER-AGGRESSIVE — Verona have won
   back-to-back (beat Atalanta 3-1, Fiorentina 2-1); Milan winless
   in 2, Leao doubtful; -1.50 may be too aggressive

3. Totals verdict: CLOSE TO FAIR — O/U 2.5 balanced; H2H suggests
   goals but both teams' styles create uncertainty

4. Discipline risk: MEDIUM — Fabbri card-active but standard

5. CMP Verdict: SLIGHT ANOMALY — Verona's recent form not reflected

6. Combined decision: SKIP (or slight lean to Verona +1.50)

7. Best bet (1.80-2.20): None in range — Milan ML 1.36 too short;
   Verona +1.50 would need odds check

8. One-line justification: Milan's H2H dominance (9 straight wins)
   vs Verona's recent form (beat Atalanta 3-1) creates uncertainty;
   market may be over-aggressive on -1.50 but no clear value in range
```

**Confidence:** LOW

*Milan should win but Verona's recent wins create uncertainty on margin.*
