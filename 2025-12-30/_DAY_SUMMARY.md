## Recommended Bets (1.80-2.20 range)

| Match | Bet | Odds | Confidence | Rationale |
|-------|-----|------|------------|-----------|
| **Forest vs Everton** | Under 2.5 | ~1.90 | MEDIUM | H2H: 8/10 games Under 2.5; both struggling to score |
| **Man Utd vs Wolves** | Man Utd -1.25 | 1.95 | MEDIUM | Wolves crisis (André suspended, 2pts, sold Cunha to opponent) > United crisis |
| Chelsea vs Bournemouth | Under 3.0 | ~1.93 | MEDIUM | H2H: last 3 draws, low-scoring |
| Arsenal vs Villa | Over 2.5 | 1.88 | MEDIUM | Both attack-minded; Villa's suspensions |

---

## Key Market Observations

### 1. Forest vs Everton: MAJOR DISAGREEMENT
- Model: Everton slight favorites (+0.25)
- Market: Forest favorites (-0.50)
- **0.75 gap is SIGNIFICANT**
- Market pricing Everton's scoring crisis (0 goals in 3)
- BUT: Everton beat Forest 3-0 at same venue 3 weeks ago
- **Lesson from Roma/Genoa:** Don't always trust market skepticism

### 2. Man Utd vs Wolves: Clash of Two Crises
- Model predicts 3.45-0.48 blowout
- Market says -1.25, Under 3.0
- **Bruno Fernandes OUT** — but...
- **André SUSPENDED** for Wolves (their best midfielder)
- **Matheus Cunha** now plays for United (was Wolves' top scorer)
- Wolves: 2 pts, 11-game losing streak, -28 GD
- **LINE MOVED: -1.50 → -1.25** (market overpricing Bruno absence?)
- **Wolves' crisis > United's crisis = potential value on -1.25**

### 3. Arsenal vs Villa: Market Aggressive
- Model: -0.75; Market: -1.25
- Market MORE confident than model (unusual)
- Kamara + Cash BOTH suspended for Villa
- Market pricing defensive structure collapse

### 4. Brighton vs West Ham: Draw Written All Over It
- Brighton unbeaten in 8 visits (6 draws, 2 wins)
- West Ham haven't beaten Brighton at home since 2017
- Both teams in poor form
- Draw @ 3.75 has value (outside range)

## What Happened

### Man Utd 1-1 Wolves (WRONG)
- **Our logic:** Wolves crisis > United crisis
- **Reality:** Bruno's absence was MORE impactful than we estimated
- **Key lesson:** "Good form vs Newcastle was temporary" — one result doesn't fix systemic issues
- United couldn't break down even the worst team in PL history

### Arsenal 4-1 Villa (CORRECT)
- **Our logic:** Villa's suspensions (Kamara + Cash) = defensive collapse
- **Reality:** Exactly what happened — 4 goals, Villa only scored at 90+4'
- Over 2.5 @ 1.88 was easy money

### Forest 0-2 Everton (CORRECT)
- **Our logic:** Market overpricing Forest despite losing 3-0 to Everton 3 weeks ago
- **Reality:** Everton dominated again — same pattern
- Under 2.5 hit, Everton +0.50 would have been even better

### Chelsea 2-2 Bournemouth (WRONG)
- **Our logic:** H2H shows low-scoring (last 3 draws)
- **Reality:** 4 goals — pattern broke
- Under 3.0 lost

### West Ham 2-2 Brighton (CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED)
- **Our call:** "Draw written all over it" — Brighton unbeaten in 8 visits
- **Reality:** Draw exactly as predicted
- **Missed opportunity:** Draw @ 3.75 was outside our range but would have paid

### Burnley 1-3 Newcastle (SKIP was correct)
- Newcastle covered easily despite defensive crisis
- SKIP was right — no edge identified

---

## Critical Error Analysis

| Our Call | Result | Lesson |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Man Utd -1.25 (Wolves crisis bigger) | Drew 1-1 | **One good result (Newcastle) doesn't fix team** |
| Under 3.0 Chelsea | 4 goals | H2H patterns can break |
| Under 2.5 Forest/Everton | 2 goals | **Recent H2H (3-0) was the key signal** |
| Over 2.5 Arsenal | 5 goals | **Suspensions = defensive collapse** |

---

## Key Lessons

### 1. One Result Doesn't Fix Systemic Issues
- Man Utd beat Newcastle 1-0 → We thought "form returning"
- Reality: Bruno's absence is IMPOSSIBLE to replace (Amorim's words were literal)
- **Rule:** Don't extrapolate single results into trend

### 2. Recent H2H at Same Venue is GOLD
- Everton beat Forest 3-0 at City Ground 3 weeks ago
- Market priced Forest as favorites (-0.50)
- We correctly identified market was wrong
- **Same pattern repeated: Everton dominated again**

### 3. Suspensions = Defensive Collapse (Not Just "Missing Players")
- Villa missing Kamara (CDM shield) + Cash (RB)
- Result: Conceded 4 goals
- Kamara specifically protects the back line — his absence was critical
- **Rule:** CDM/defensive midfielder suspension = lean OVER

### 4. Draw Patterns at Specific Venues
- Brighton unbeaten in 8 visits to London Stadium (6 draws)
- Result: 2-2 draw
- We identified it but didn't bet (odds outside range)
- **Lesson:** When H2H shows extreme draw pattern, trust it

### 5. "Temporary Form" Warning
- User correctly noted: "Man United good in Newcastle is just temporary"
- This is the key insight we missed
- **One win doesn't fix: missing captain, formation instability, AFCON absences**

---

## Rule Updates (Pending)

### To Add to MUST_USE_LOGIC.md:

**1. Single Result Extrapolation Warning:**
> One positive result does NOT indicate form recovery when:
> - Key player (captain/creative hub) is still absent
> - Multiple structural issues remain (AFCON, formation changes)
> - Previous results showed chaos (4-4 vs Bournemouth)

**2. Recent Same-Venue H2H Priority:**
> When Team A beat Team B at same venue within 3-4 weeks:
> - This is the STRONGEST signal
> - Market often underweights this
> - Trust the pattern to repeat

**3. CDM/Defensive Shield Suspension = OVER:**
> When defensive midfielder is suspended:
> - Team loses its protective shield
> - Back line exposed to direct attacks
> - Lean OVER regardless of opponent quality
