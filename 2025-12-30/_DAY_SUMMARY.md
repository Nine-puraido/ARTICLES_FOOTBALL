| Match | Bet | Odds | Confidence | Rationale |
|-------|-----|------|------------|-----------|
| **Forest vs Everton** | Under 2.5 | ~1.90 | MEDIUM | H2H: 8/10 games Under 2.5; both struggling to score |
| **Man Utd vs Wolves** | Under 3.0 | 1.93 | MEDIUM | Bruno OUT; United's creative crisis |
| Chelsea vs Bournemouth | Under 3.0 | ~1.93 | MEDIUM | H2H: last 3 draws, low-scoring |
| Arsenal vs Villa | Over 2.5 | 1.88 | MEDIUM | Both attack-minded; Villa's suspensions |

## Key Market Observations

### 1. Forest vs Everton: MAJOR DISAGREEMENT
- Model: Everton slight favorites (+0.25)
- Market: Forest favorites (-0.50)
- **0.75 gap is SIGNIFICANT**
- Market pricing Everton's scoring crisis (0 goals in 3)
- BUT: Everton beat Forest 3-0 at same venue 3 weeks ago
- **Lesson from Roma/Genoa:** Don't always trust market skepticism

### 2. Man Utd vs Wolves: Creative Crisis Ignored by Model
- Model predicts 3.45-0.48 blowout
- Market says Under 3.0
- **Bruno Fernandes OUT** changes everything
- 4-1 win 8 days ago was WITH Bruno
- **LINE MOVED: -1.50 → -1.25** (market getting MORE skeptical)
- Gap now **0.75** — significant disagreement

### 3. Arsenal vs Villa: Market Aggressive
- Model: -0.75; Market: -1.25
- Market MORE confident than model (unusual)
- Kamara + Cash BOTH suspended for Villa
- Market pricing defensive structure collapse

### 4. Brighton vs West Ham: Draw Written All Over It
- Brighton unbeaten in 8 visits (6 draws, 2 wins)
- West Ham haven't beaten Brighton at home since 2017
- Both teams in poor form
- Draw @ 3.75 has value (outside range)
