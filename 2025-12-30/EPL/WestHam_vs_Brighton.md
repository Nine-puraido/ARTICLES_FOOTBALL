## MARKET LOGIC ANALYSIS

### Why Market is Softer Than Model

**Model says Brighton +0.75; Market says +0.25**

| Factor | Market's View |
|--------|---------------|
| Brighton's own poor form | Winless in 5 |
| H2H pattern | 6 of 8 visits = draws |
| West Ham desperation | Relegation fight motivation |
| Both teams struggling | Chaotic game expected |

### Why Market is Lower on Totals

**Model says 3.00; Market says 2.50**

| Factor | Market's View |
|--------|---------------|
| Both teams' recent form | Not scoring freely |
| H2H draws pattern | Low-scoring affairs |
| Weather/conditions | Standard winter football |

---

## COMPARABLE MATCH PRICING (CMP)

### Brighton away vs relegation-zone teams:

Expected line: +0.25 to +0.50

Today's +0.25 is **CONSISTENT** given:
- Brighton's own poor form (winless in 5)
- H2H pattern of draws at London Stadium

**CMP Verdict:** **CONSISTENT** — No anomaly

---

## JOINT ANALYSIS (AH + TOTALS)

| Observation | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Market softer on AH | H2H draws pattern respected |
| Market lower on Totals | Neither team scoring freely |
| H2H: 8 visits = 0 Brighton losses | Draw likely outcome |

**Combined Interpretation:**
- Market pricing **DRAW** as most likely outcome
- Neither team's form justifies backing either side
- **Draw @ 3.75 is the market's implied play**

---

## FINAL STATEMENT

```
1. Market is protecting against: The H2H pattern of draws at
   London Stadium (6 draws in 8 Brighton visits since 2017)

2. AH verdict: MARKET CAUTIOUS — +0.25 vs model's +0.75 reflects
   Brighton's own poor form and H2H draw tendency

3. Totals verdict: MARKET CAUTIOUS — Under 2.5 vs model's 3.0
   reflects neither team's attacking form

4. Discipline risk: MEDIUM-HIGH — Salisbury active + West Ham
   desperation = cards likely

5. CMP Verdict: CONSISTENT — Brighton +0.25 away vs struggling
   team matches normal pricing given H2H

6. Combined decision: SKIP on AH / Consider Draw

7. Best bet (1.80-2.20): None in optimal range — Draw @ 3.75
   has value given H2H but outside preferred odds range

8. One-line justification: Both teams struggling, H2H shows draws,
   neither AH nor Totals offers clear edge in 1.80-2.20 range
```

**Confidence:** LOW

*This match screams "draw" given H2H pattern (6 draws at London Stadium) and both teams' poor form. No clear betting edge in preferred odds range.*

## BETTING OPTIONS

| Bet | Odds | Assessment |
|-----|------|------------|
| Brighton ML | @ 2.38 | AVOID — Own poor form |
| West Ham ML | @ 2.80 | AVOID — Awful home record |
| **Draw** | @ 3.75 | CONSIDER — H2H pattern strong |
| Under 2.5 | @ ~1.85 | MARGINAL — Both struggling to score |
| BTTS Yes | @ ~1.85 | H2H shows BTTS in 4/5 |
