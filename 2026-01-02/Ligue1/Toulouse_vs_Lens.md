## FINAL STATEMENT

```
1. Market is protecting against: Nothing specific — model and market
   are aligned on Lens superiority

2. AH verdict: MARKET RIGHT — Agreement at +0.75; Lens in elite form
   (7-game winning streak, top of table)

3. Totals verdict: MARKET RIGHT — 2.5 is fair given both teams'
   profiles and AFCON absences

4. Discipline risk: LOW — No red flags identified

5. CMP Verdict: CONSISTENT — Standard pricing for league leaders
   away at mid-table

6. Combined decision: SKIP

7. Best bet (1.80-2.20): None — No disagreement to exploit

8. One-line justification: Model and market agree; Lens in elite
   form but away at solid home side; no edge identified
```

**Confidence:** LOW

*No investigation needed. Market and model aligned. Lens should win but pricing is fair.*
