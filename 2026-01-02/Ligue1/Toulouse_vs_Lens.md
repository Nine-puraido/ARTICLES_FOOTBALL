## FINAL STATEMENT

```
1. Market is protecting against: Toulouse's home strength — market
   is pricing pick'em despite Lens being 1st with 7-game winning streak

2. AH verdict: MARKET SOFTER — Gap of +0.75 (Model Lens -0.75 vs
   Market 0.00). Market respects Toulouse's home record (lost only
   twice at home) more than model does

3. Totals verdict: MARKET RIGHT — 2.5 is fair given both teams'
   profiles and AFCON absences

4. Discipline risk: LOW — No red flags identified

5. CMP Verdict: NEEDS INVESTIGATION — Market pricing league leaders
   away as coin flip is unusual; Toulouse home fortress may justify

6. Combined decision: SKIP

7. Best bet (1.80-2.20): None — Market logic appears sound given
   Toulouse home record, but gap is significant

8. One-line justification: Market respects Toulouse's home record
   (lost only twice at home) more than model; Lens -0.75 has VALUE
   but market caution is justified
```

**Confidence:** LOW-MEDIUM

*Significant gap (+0.75) but market may be correct to respect Toulouse's home strength. Lens in elite form but market pricing as coin flip suggests insider caution.*

## BETTING OPTIONS

| Bet | Odds | Assessment |
|-----|------|------------|
| Lens ML | @ ~1.90 | CONSIDER — Model favors but market cautious |
| Lens 0.00 | @ ~1.95 | Covers on any win |
| Over 2.5 | @ ~1.90 | FAIR |
| Under 2.5 | @ ~1.90 | FAIR |

**Note:** Model favors Lens -0.75 but market is 0.00 (pick'em). Gap is significant (+0.75) but Toulouse's home record may justify caution.
