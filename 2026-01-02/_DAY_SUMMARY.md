## Pre-Match Analysis Summary

### 1. Cagliari vs Milan (Serie A, 18:00)
- **Gap:** Total -0.75 (Model 3.25 vs Market 2.5)
- **Key Finding:** Market is risk-managing due to:
  - Pulisic DOUBTFUL, Nkunku OUT
  - Allegri warned of fixture congestion ("8 games in 6 weeks")
  - Cagliari beat Roma 1-0 at home (can organize defensively)
  - Referee Abisso averages 4.3 yellows/game
- **Milan Away:** Unbeaten (4W-3D) but 47% Under 2.5 ratio
- **Decision:** SKIP — Market logic is sound; no clear edge

### 2. Rayo vs Getafe (La Liga Derby, 20:00)
- **Gap:** AH -0.50 (Market MORE aggressive: -0.75 vs Model -0.25)
- **Key Finding:** DERBY STALEMATE PATTERN
  - H2H: Rayo unbeaten in 8 straight (3W, **5D**)
  - **4 of last 7 were 0-0**
  - Last 3 meetings: ONLY 1 GOAL TOTAL
  - Rayo home: Only 1 win all season (5 draws)
- **Market Logic:** Over-aggressive due to Getafe crisis (4-0 loss)
- **Reality:** H2H shows DRAW most likely
- **Decision:** SKIP — Market over-aggressive; Draw @ 2.89 has value but outside range

### 3. Toulouse vs Lens (Ligue 1, 19:00)
- **Gap:** None (0.00 on both AH and Total)
- **Key Finding:** Model and market agree
  - Lens: 1st place, 7-game winning streak
  - Toulouse: 8th, solid at home
- **Decision:** SKIP — No disagreement to exploit
