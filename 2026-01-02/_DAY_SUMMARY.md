## Pre-Match Analysis Summary

### 1. Cagliari vs Milan (Serie A, 18:00)
- **Gap:** AH +0.25 (Market softer: -1.00 vs Model -1.25) + Total -1.00 SIGNIFICANT
- **Key Finding:** Market is risk-managing due to:
  - Pulisic DOUBTFUL, Nkunku OUT
  - Allegri warned of fixture congestion ("8 games in 6 weeks")
  - Cagliari beat Roma 1-0 at home (can organize defensively)
  - BOTH teams have injuries — no clear advantage
  - Referee Abisso averages 4.3 yellows/game
- **Milan Away:** Unbeaten (4W-3D) but 47% Under 2.5 ratio
- **Decision:** SKIP — Market logic is sound; both sides have injuries

### 2. Rayo vs Getafe (La Liga Derby, 20:00)
- **Gap:** 0.00 on both AH (-0.25) and Total (1.75) — AGREEMENT
- **Key Finding:** DERBY STALEMATE PATTERN
  - H2H: Rayo unbeaten in 8 straight (3W, **5D**)
  - **4 of last 7 were 0-0**
  - Last 3 meetings: ONLY 1 GOAL TOTAL
  - Rayo home: Only 1 win all season (5 draws)
- **Market Logic:** Correctly priced as tight derby
- **Decision:** SKIP — Model and market agree; no edge to exploit

### 3. Toulouse vs Lens (Ligue 1, 19:00)
- **Gap:** AH +0.75 SIGNIFICANT (Model Lens -0.75 vs Market 0.00 pick'em)
- **Key Finding:** Market respects Toulouse home more than model
  - Lens: 1st place, 7-game winning streak
  - Toulouse: 8th, lost only twice at home all season
- **Market Logic:** Pricing league leaders away as coin flip is unusual but Toulouse home record may justify
- **Decision:** SKIP — Gap exists but market caution may be justified
