| Cagliari fighting relegation | Defensive approach likely |

|--------|---------------|
| Pulisic/Nkunku doubts | Milan attack compromised |
| Allegri's fatigue warning | Intensity management |

## COMPARABLE MATCH PRICING (CMP)

### Milan Away vs Bottom-Half Teams:

**Recent Away Results:**
- Lecce: 0-2 (Under)
- Monza: 1-2 (Over)
- Parma: 2-2 (Even)

**Typical Total:** 2.5-2.75

**CMP Verdict:** **CONSISTENT**

---

## JOINT ANALYSIS (AH + TOTALS)

| Observation | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| AH agreement (+1.25) | Both see Milan winning comfortably |
| Totals gap (-0.75) | Market expects controlled win, not blowout |
| Pulisic uncertainty | Reduces attacking sharpness |
| Cagliari's home defense | Capable of organizing (Roma 1-0) |

**Combined Interpretation:**
- Market pricing **2-0 or 2-1 Milan win**
- NOT expecting 3+ goal margin despite quality gap
- Allegri's load management + Cagliari's desperation = tight game

---

## FINAL STATEMENT

```
1. Market is protecting against: Cagliari's home defensive discipline
   combined with Milan's fixture congestion and compromised attack
   (Pulisic/Nkunku injuries) leading to a controlled, low-scoring win

2. AH verdict: MARKET RIGHT — Agreement at +1.25; Milan superiority
   recognized by both model and market

3. Totals verdict: RISK-MANAGING — Market's 2.5 vs model's 3.25
   is defensible given Cagliari's home defense (Roma 1-0) and
   Milan's 47% U2.5 ratio in Serie A

4. Discipline risk: MEDIUM-HIGH — Abisso averages 4.3 yellows/game;
   Cagliari's tactical fouling at home will disrupt tempo

5. CMP Verdict: CONSISTENT — 2.5 totals align with Milan's away
   baseline; no structural anomaly

6. Combined decision: SKIP

7. Best bet (1.80-2.20): None — No clear edge; market logic is sound

8. One-line justification: Cagliari's home defensive setup + Milan's
   fatigue + Pulisic uncertainty + high-card referee = 2.5 total
   is justified, not bait
```

**Confidence:** LOW-MEDIUM

*Market logic is sound. Cagliari can organize at home (Roma 1-0). Milan's attack is compromised. No edge identified.*

## BETTING OPTIONS

| Bet | Odds | Assessment |
|-----|------|------------|
| Milan ML | @ 1.54 | TOO SHORT |
| Milan -1.25 | @ ~1.95 | FAIR — no edge |
| Over 2.5 | @ 1.89 | Model-preferred but risky |
| Under 2.5 | @ 1.91 | Market-preferred, justified |
