## MARKET LOGIC ANALYSIS

### Why Market and Model AGREE on -0.25

| Factor | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
| Rayo home: Only 1 win (5 draws) | Home "fortress" is draws, not wins |
| Rayo scoring: 0.76 goals/home | Limited attacking output |
| Getafe's 4-4-2 block | Bordalás system designed for this |
| H2H: 5 of 7 draws | Stalemate pattern recognized |
| Both teams have injuries + AFCON | Reduced quality on both sides |

**Market correctly priced this as tight derby**

---

## COMPARABLE MATCH PRICING (CMP)

### Rayo Home vs Mid-Table Away:

**Recent Home Results:**
- Rayo 0-0 Real Betis (draw)
- Rayo 1-0 Getafe (May 2025)
- Multiple 0-0 draws

**Rayo Home AH Coverage:**
- On -0.25 line: Covers on any win
- On -0.50 line: 6/7 covered (86%)

**CMP Verdict:** **CONSISTENT**
- Market now correctly priced as slight edge
- -0.25 is fair given H2H draw pattern (5 of 7)
- Rayo's home record: Draws, not wins

---

## JOINT ANALYSIS (AH + TOTALS)

| Observation | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Market -0.25 Rayo | Slight edge — consistent with model |
| Totals 1.75 agreement | Both expect Under |
| H2H: 5 of 7 draws | Draw most likely outcome |

**CASE F — Agreement:**
- AH and Totals both aligned between model and market
- H2H stalemate pattern supports tight match pricing
- No conflict to exploit

---

## FINAL STATEMENT

```
1. Market is protecting against: Nothing specific — model and market
   now agree this is a tight, low-scoring derby

2. AH verdict: MARKET RIGHT — Agreement at -0.25; H2H stalemate
   pattern (5 of 7 draws) correctly priced by both

3. Totals verdict: MARKET RIGHT — Under 1.75 is fair; both teams'
   scoring profiles and H2H history (4 goalless in 7) support

4. Discipline risk: MEDIUM-HIGH — Ortiz Arias elevated recently;
   derby physicality expected

5. CMP Verdict: CONSISTENT — Market correctly priced as slight edge

6. Combined decision: SKIP

7. Best bet (1.80-2.20): None — No disagreement to exploit

8. One-line justification: Model and market agree on -0.25 AH and
   1.75 Total; H2H stalemate pattern (5 of 7 draws) supports tight
   pricing — no edge identified
```

**Confidence:** LOW

*Model and market agree. This is a stalemate derby. 5 of last 7 H2H were draws. No edge to exploit.*

---

## BETTING OPTIONS

| Bet | Odds | Assessment |
|-----|------|------------|
| Rayo ML | @ 2.04 | FAIR — but H2H shows draws |
| Draw | @ 2.89 | H2H pattern (5 of 7) but outside range |
| Rayo -0.25 | @ ~1.95 | FAIR — no edge |
| Under 1.75 | @ 1.84 | FAIR — 4 goalless in last 7 H2H |

**Note:** Model and market agree — no clear edge identified
