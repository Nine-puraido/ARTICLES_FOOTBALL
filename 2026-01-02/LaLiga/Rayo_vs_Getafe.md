## MARKET LOGIC ANALYSIS

### Why Market is MORE Aggressive on Rayo (-0.75 vs -0.25)

| Factor | Market's View |
|--------|---------------|
| Rayo unbeaten in 7 home games | Home fortress perception |
| Rayo 8-game H2H dominance | Psychological edge |
| Getafe crisis (4-0, 5 losses in 6) | Panic-reaction to form collapse |
| Public money on Rayo | Volume management |

### Why Model is More Cautious (-0.25)

| Factor | Model's View |
|--------|--------------|
| Rayo home: Only 1 win (5 draws) | Home "fortress" is draws, not wins |
| Rayo scoring: 0.76 goals/home | Can't score enough to cover -0.75 |
| Getafe's 4-4-2 block | Bordalás system designed for this |
| H2H: 5 of 7 draws | Stalemate pattern |

---

## COMPARABLE MATCH PRICING (CMP)

### Rayo Home vs Mid-Table Away:

**Recent Home Results:**
- Rayo 0-0 Real Betis (draw)
- Rayo 1-0 Getafe (May 2025)
- Multiple 0-0 draws

**Rayo Home AH Coverage:**
- On -0.50 line: 6/7 covered (86%)
- On -0.75 line: **Only 1/7 covered (14%)**

**CMP Verdict:** **CONSISTENT but AGGRESSIVE**
- Market adjusted for Getafe crisis
- But -0.75 requires WIN, not draw
- Rayo's home record: Draws, not wins

---

## JOINT ANALYSIS (AH + TOTALS)

| Observation | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Market -0.75 Rayo | Aggressive — requires 1-0 minimum |
| Totals 1.75 agreement | Both expect Under |
| H2H: 5 of 7 draws | Draw most likely outcome |

**CONFLICT (CASE E):**
- AH says Rayo wins by margin
- Totals says low-scoring
- H2H says DRAW
- **These don't align cleanly**

---

## FINAL STATEMENT

```
1. Market is protecting against: A blowout Rayo win (2+ goals) using
   tight total while pricing aggressive -0.75 AH to capture volume

2. AH verdict: RISK-MANAGING — Market over-aggressive relative to
   Rayo's home output (0.76 goals) and H2H draw pattern (5 of 7)

3. Totals verdict: MARKET RIGHT — Under 1.75 is fair; both teams'
   scoring profiles and H2H history (4 goalless in 7) support

4. Discipline risk: MEDIUM-HIGH — Ortiz Arias elevated recently;
   derby physicality expected

5. CMP Verdict: CONSISTENT but AGGRESSIVE — Market adjusted for
   Getafe crisis but -0.75 requires win, not draw

6. Combined decision: SKIP

7. Best bet (1.80-2.20): None — CASE E conflict; H2H stalemate
   pattern suggests draw most likely

8. One-line justification: Market's -0.75 AH reflects volume
   management + Getafe crisis perception, but Rayo's home record
   (1W-5D-1L) and H2H stalemate (5 of 7 draws) suggest draw is
   most likely outcome — no edge on either side
```

**Confidence:** LOW

*This is a stalemate derby. 5 of last 7 were draws. Market is over-aggressive on Rayo. Model is more realistic. But no clear bet emerges.*

## BETTING OPTIONS

| Bet | Odds | Assessment |
|-----|------|------------|
| Rayo ML | @ 2.04 | CONSIDER — but H2H shows draws |
| Draw | @ 2.89 | **BEST VALUE** — H2H pattern (5 of 7) |
| Getafe +0.75 | @ ~1.95 | VALUE — covers on draw |
| Under 1.75 | @ 1.84 | SUPPORTED — 4 goalless in last 7 H2H |

**Note:** Draw @ 2.89 has value given H2H pattern, but outside 1.80-2.20 range
