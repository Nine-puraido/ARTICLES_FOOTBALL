- **Total Gap (-1.00):** **SIGNIFICANT** - Market expects 1 goal fewer than model

**Classification:** **POTENTIAL MODEL ERROR**
- Model favors Fulham by 1.25 goals
- Market prices as a pick'em (coin flip)

### HEAD-TO-HEAD (CRITICAL — EXPLAINS THE GAP)

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| **West Ham HOME vs Fulham** | **7 wins in last 8** |
| **Last Meeting (Jan 2025)** | **West Ham 3-2 Fulham** at London Stadium |
| **Overall H2H (111 matches)** | West Ham 52, Fulham 34, Draws 25 |
| **Since 2001** | West Ham 19 wins in 35 games |

**January 2025 Match Detail:**
- West Ham 3-2 Fulham (Graham Potter's first PL game)
- Soler (31'), Soucek (33'), Paqueta (67') for West Ham
- Iwobi (51', 78') for Fulham — **Iwobi is now at AFCON**

**Pattern:** West Ham have MASSIVE home dominance vs Fulham. This explains why market is a pick'em despite model favoring Fulham.

## REFEREE & DISCIPLINE CHECK

**Referee:** Not confirmed in search results. Assume standard Premier League official.

### Team Discipline Assessment

| Team | Profile | Risk |
|------|---------|------|
| West Ham | Physical, desperate | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| Fulham | Technical, controlled | LOW |

**Volatility Assessment:** **MEDIUM**
- West Ham's relegation desperation could lead to physical approach
- Fulham missing key players may reduce quality

---

## TOTALS ANALYSIS

**Model expects:** 3.50 goals
**Market offers:** O/U 2.5 (O: 1.82 / U: 2.00)
**Gap:** -1.00 (SIGNIFICANT)

### Evidence FOR Lower Scoring (Market's View):

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| **Fulham AFCON absences** | Iwobi (2 goals in Jan), Bassey, Chukwueze all OUT |
| **Wilson doubtful** | Fulham's in-form player may miss |
| West Ham defensive setup | Will sit deep at home |
| Relegation stakes | Cagey, defensive approach |

### Evidence FOR Higher Scoring (Model's View):

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| H2H pattern | Last meeting was 3-2 (5 goals) |
| Both teams' defensive issues | West Ham conceding, Fulham missing Bassey |
| West Ham need goals | Fighting relegation |

**VERDICT:** Market's 2.5 is justified. Fulham's AFCON absences (especially Iwobi who scored twice in January) significantly weakens their attack. **Under 2.5 @ 2.00** is the value play.

---

## WHY MODEL IS LIKELY WRONG

The model predicts Fulham -1.25, but:

| Model Assumption | Reality |
|------------------|---------|
| Fulham full strength | **Missing 3 AFCON players + Wilson doubtful** |
| Standard away game | **West Ham 7/8 home wins in H2H** |
| Fulham superior | **West Ham won 3-2 at home in January** |

The model appears to ignore:
1. West Ham's MASSIVE home H2H dominance (7/8 wins)
2. Fulham's 3 AFCON absences (Bassey, Chukwueze, Iwobi)
3. Wilson doubtful (6G, 4A in 7 games)
4. West Ham's relegation desperation at home

**Market is CORRECT to price this as a pick'em.**

---

## MARKET LOGIC ANALYSIS

### Why Market is a Pick'em (Not Fulham -1.25)

| Factor | Justification |
|--------|---------------|
| **H2H Dominance** | West Ham 7/8 home wins vs Fulham |
| **AFCON Impact** | Fulham missing Bassey, Chukwueze, Iwobi |
| **Wilson Doubtful** | Fulham's in-form player may miss |
| **Relegation Factor** | West Ham fighting at home |
| **January Result** | West Ham 3-2 Fulham at this venue |

### CMP VERDICT: **MODEL ERROR**

The -1.25 AH gap is NOT market mispricing — it's the MODEL being wrong. The market correctly accounts for H2H and AFCON absences.

---

## FINAL STATEMENT

```
1. Market is protecting against: Model ignoring West Ham's massive
   home H2H dominance (7/8 wins) and Fulham's triple AFCON absences
   (Bassey, Chukwueze, Iwobi) + Wilson doubtful

2. AH verdict: MODEL ERROR — Model's Fulham -1.25 ignores West Ham's
   7/8 home wins in H2H and Fulham's 3 AFCON absences; pick'em is
   correct pricing

3. Totals verdict: MARKET RIGHT — O/U 2.5 correctly prices Fulham's
   missing attackers (Iwobi scored twice in Jan) + Wilson doubtful;
   Under 2.5 @ 2.00 has value

4. Discipline risk: MEDIUM — West Ham's relegation desperation may
   increase physicality

5. CMP Verdict: MODEL ERROR — Market correctly prices H2H + absences

6. Combined decision: REDUCE (on Under 2.5)

7. Best bet (1.80-2.20): Under 2.5 @ 2.00 — Fulham missing Iwobi
   (scored twice in Jan), Bassey, Chukwueze (AFCON) + Wilson doubtful
   = reduced attacking threat vs defensive West Ham

8. One-line justification: West Ham's 7/8 home H2H wins + Fulham
   missing 3 AFCON players (Iwobi who scored 2 in Jan) + Wilson
   doubtful = model wrong on Fulham -1.25; market's pick'em is
   correct; Under 2.5 @ 2.00 is the value play
```

**Confidence:** MEDIUM

*Model appears significantly wrong. Market correctly prices H2H dominance and AFCON absences.*

---

## REASONING

The -1.25 AH gap is a **MODEL ERROR**, not market mispricing:

1. **Confirmed fact:** West Ham won 7 of last 8 home games vs Fulham
2. **Confirmed fact:** West Ham beat Fulham 3-2 at London Stadium in January 2025
3. **Confirmed fact:** Fulham missing Bassey, Chukwueze, Iwobi (all AFCON)
4. **Confirmed fact:** Iwobi scored twice in that 3-2 loss — now unavailable
5. **Confirmed fact:** Wilson (6G, 4A in 7 games) is doubtful
6. **Confirmed fact:** West Ham in relegation zone, fighting at home

The model treats this as "Fulham vs average opponent." The market prices **this specific match**: West Ham at home (where they dominate Fulham) against a Fulham missing three key players to AFCON.

**Trust market. Under 2.5 @ 2.00 is the play.**
