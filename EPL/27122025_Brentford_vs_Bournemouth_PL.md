## REFEREE & DISCIPLINE CHECK

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| 2024-25 Season | 26 games, 99 yellows, 3 reds |
| **Avg Yellows/Match** | **3.8** — CARD-HEAVY |

### Team Discipline Assessment

| Team | Profile | Risk |
|------|---------|------|
| Brentford | Physical, pressing style | MEDIUM |
| Bournemouth | Attacking but vulnerable | LOW-MEDIUM |

**Volatility Assessment:** **MEDIUM-HIGH**
- Bankes is card-heavy (3.8 yellows/game)
- Brentford's physical approach + Bournemouth's desperation = card risk
- Could slow game tempo with frequent stoppages

---

## TOTALS ANALYSIS

**Model expects:** 3.50 goals
**Market offers:** O/U 2.75 (O: 1.90 / U: 1.96)
**Gap:** -0.75 (SIGNIFICANT)

### Evidence FOR Lower Scoring (Market's View):

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| **Bournemouth's crisis** | 8-game winless, attacking confidence gone |
| Both teams' AFCON absences | Onyeka, Ouattara (Brentford) out |
| Referee factor | Bankes' 3.8 yellows/game = stoppages |
| H2H pattern | Brentford control games vs Bournemouth |
| Recent Brentford result | Won 2-0 (clean sheet) |

### Evidence FOR Higher Scoring (Model's View):

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Bournemouth defense | Conceded 28 goals (worst in top 16) |
| Man Utd 4-4 result | Bournemouth can be in open games |
| Brentford's attacking | Lewis-Potter in form |

**VERDICT:** Market's 2.75 is close to fair. Bournemouth's defensive issues argue for goals, but their attacking crisis suggests they won't contribute much. **Under 2.75 @ 1.96** has slight value.

---

## MARKET LOGIC ANALYSIS

### Why Market is Softer on Brentford AH

| Factor | Justification |
|--------|---------------|
| Bournemouth can defend | Despite crisis, drew with Burnley |
| Brentford's AFCON absences | Onyeka, Ouattara missing |
| Conservative approach | Brentford may control rather than dominate |

### Why Market is Lower on Totals

| Factor | Justification |
|--------|---------------|
| Bournemouth's attack | Scoring less on winless run |
| Brentford clean sheet | Won 2-0 last game |
| H2H pattern | Brentford typically control these games |

### CMP VERDICT: **CONSISTENT**

Market correctly prices Brentford's H2H dominance while accounting for both teams' absences. No anomaly detected.

---

## FINAL STATEMENT

```
1. Market is protecting against: Bournemouth's 8-game winless streak
   and Brentford's AFCON absences (Onyeka, Ouattara) leading to a
   controlled Brentford win rather than a blowout

2. AH verdict: MARKET RIGHT — Brentford's H2H dominance (unbeaten in
   6, won last 4) supports them, but -0.25 accounts for AFCON absences

3. Totals verdict: CLOSE TO FAIR — O/U 2.75 balances Bournemouth's
   poor defense (28 conceded) vs their attacking crisis (8-game
   winless); Under 2.75 @ 1.96 has slight value

4. Discipline risk: MEDIUM-HIGH — Bankes averages 3.8 yellows/game;
   could slow tempo with frequent stoppages

5. CMP Verdict: CONSISTENT — Both lines within expected ranges

6. Combined decision: REDUCE

7. Best bet (1.80-2.20): Under 2.75 @ 1.96 — Bournemouth's attack
   in crisis (8-game winless) + Brentford 2-0 clean sheet last game
   + Bankes' card-heavy style = controlled, lower-scoring affair

8. One-line justification: Brentford's decade-long dominance over
   Bournemouth (unbeaten since 2014) + Bournemouth's 8-game winless
   crisis + both teams' AFCON absences = controlled Brentford win;
   Under 2.75 @ 1.96 is the value play
```

**Confidence:** MEDIUM

*Brentford's H2H dominance is clear, but AFCON absences on both sides create uncertainty on margin.*

---

## REASONING

The +0.50 AH gap and -0.75 Totals gap are mostly explained:

1. **Confirmed fact:** Brentford unbeaten vs Bournemouth in 6 PL meetings (last win 2014)
2. **Confirmed fact:** Bournemouth on 8-game winless streak
3. **Confirmed fact:** Brentford missing Onyeka + Ouattara (AFCON)
4. **Confirmed fact:** Brentford won 2-0 vs Wolves (clean sheet)
5. **Confirmed fact:** Bournemouth conceded 28 goals (worst in top 16)
6. **Confirmed fact:** Bankes averages 3.8 yellows/game

Brentford should win given dominant H2H, but both teams' absences and Bournemouth's attacking crisis suggest a lower-scoring game.

**Under 2.75 @ 1.96 is the value play.**
